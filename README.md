# wikiscrape
first attempt at a webscraper

PURPOSE:
  This tool scrapes wikipedia for summaries of top U.S cities and displays for the user. 
  Wikipedia is a great free resource for practicing use of the requests library and features of BeautifulSoup4.
  
HOW TO:
  Download wikiscrape.py and put it on your desktop
  open terminal (on linux or mac)
  from terminal: pip3 install requests
  from terminal: pip3 install BeautifulSoup4
  from terminal: cd Desktop #(or wherever you are holding the file)
  from terminal: python3 wikiscrape.py
 Now you can type in any major U.S city name and wikiscrape will print info in paragraph increments.
 yes for more info, no to stop program.
  That's it!
